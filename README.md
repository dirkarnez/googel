Googel
======
> My friend always laugh at me for typing "Google" wrongly to "Googel" everytime. So...

To make fun of Google and myself, this is a frontend of my personal search engine

### Install as a service
- copy to `/etc/systemd/system/`
- `sudo chmod +x googel.service`
- `sudo systemctl enable googel`
- `sudo systemctl status googel`
